#INTRODUCE
Hello guys!
This is a my program language. I created it and it's like as my child. Althoulth it's simple and boring. But it have been created for 1 hours.

So that, basics command:
To print anythings to console:
'<<' anything       #a string, a vars,....
To input from keyboard:
input text '>>' var 
To quit:
exit()
